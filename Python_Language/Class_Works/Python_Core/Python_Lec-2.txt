                              Why we used python?


  # Desinged to be easy to learn and master :

     - clean, clear syntax.
     - Very few keywords.

  # Highly portable :

   - Runs almost anywhere-high end servers and workstations,down to windows CE.
   - uses machine independent byte-code.

  # Extensible :

   - Designed to be extensible using C/C++,
     Allowing access to many external libraries.

  # clean syntax plus high-level data types :

    - Leads to fast coding (1st language in universities)

  # Uses white-space to delimit blocks :
  
  # Variables do not need declaration :

  # Reduced development time :
  
    - Code in 2*10X shorter than C,C++,JAVA.
  
  # Less training :
    
    - Language is very easy to learn.
